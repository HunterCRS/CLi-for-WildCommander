## Installation

For usage Cli requires the latest version of WildCommder. You can get it [here](https://code.google.com/p/zx-evo-fpga/source/browse/#svn%2Fbranches%2Ftslabs%2Fpentevo%2Fsoft%2FWC%2Fexe).
Simple copy CLI.WMF into WC directory and run manually or write into wc.ini:

    Wild Commander configuration file v0.1
    CLI     .WMF

Restart WildCommder, press F10 and select "Command Line Interface" in menu list. Also you
can press ENTER at the *.sh file and start the execution of the script without running CLi.

## Usage

Type "help" into command line for the list available commands.

	1>help

You also can you use escape codes like \\xNN, where NN - hex value. For example \\x10\\x00 - switch ink to the
black color, or \\x11\\x0F switch paper into white color. Code \\x10\\x10 - return ink to the default color.

## Emulation

If you don't have a real PentEvo/ZX Evolution with firmware from [TS-Labs](https://code.google.com/p/zx-evo-fpga/source/browse/#svn%2Fbranches%2Ftslabs%2Fpentevo%2Favr%2Fcurrent%2Fdefault)
but you want to test this platform & software, you can download "Unreal Speccy" emulator TS-Labs edition [here](https://code.google.com/p/zx-evo-fpga/source/browse/branches/tslabs/pentevo/unreal/Unreal/bin/unreal.7z).

## Building

To build the project from source we use [sjasmplus](http://sourceforge.net/projects/sjasmplus/) assembler,
but you can use any available assembler that supports Zilog Z80 processor.
